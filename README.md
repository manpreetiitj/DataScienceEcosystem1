Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

result = (3 * 4) + 5
result
​
17
This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# Function to convert minutes to hours
def minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    return minutes / 60
​
minutes = 200
​
hours = minutes_to_hours(minutes)
​
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")
​
200 minutes is equal to 3.3333333333333335 hours.
